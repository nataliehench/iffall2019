		<h3>Natalie Hench</h3>

				<li> My name is Natalie, and I'm a Psych Major and a Comunications Design Second Major. I am currently a fifth year. </li> &nbsp;
				<li> I found out about this class when I joined the Second Major for Communications Design last year. </li>&nbsp;
				<LI>I do not have any previous experience with HTML, CSS, or JS</LI>&nbsp;
				<LI>I hope to learn the basics of how design is coded. For instance, I'm curious about how a typeface or image is written in html.</LI>&nbsp;
				<LI>Something that I think makes a big difference in designing for screen is the aspect of scrolling. Having a continuous unlimited flow in a document allows for a different viewing experience, and therefore a lot of different design options. </LI>&nbsp;
				<LI> An example of effective design I found is this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/08/magazine/25-songs-future-of-music.html#/intro" > New York Times Article </a> about 25 songs that show the future of music. I think it utilizes the vertical layout really well, and it's interesting to look at because of the animations. </LI>&nbsp;
				<LI>A website that exemplifies communication is <a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> which is a place for designers to display their work for a community of other designers and potential employers. The site is easy to navigate based on what you are looking for. For example, if you find something by a specific artist you can easily find more of her work.</LI>&nbsp;
				<LI>A website that I find works well is <a href="https://order.sweetgreen.com/"> Sweetgreen's</a> that they use for online orders. I think its really clear what steps you need to follow and how to customize your order, location, and other necessary information. Its easy to navigate and also pleasant to look at.</LI>&nbsp;
