<div>
	<h2>First Postcard</h2>

	<div>This image works really well at both sizes because of the vertical element of the silhouette and the more horizontal layout. I think the cropping on the mobile version should aim not to divide the sun in half because it feels a little awkward. Try bumping up the weight on your type as well as the point size to make it more legible. I would also try dark text over the light sky background. </div>

	<h2>Second Postcard</h2>
	<div>This image is also really good for this project because the background provides many good places to put the text. I think again the text could be a larger and have more weight to get it to be more legible. I think a gradient that fades into the bottom could also help give your text the attention it needs. In the mobile version try moving the text to the sky, it has a better background color for high contrast wiht text.</div>


	<h2>Third Postcard</h2>
	<div>The text in your desktop version is hard to read because the background is not as solid as the others, try moving it up to the trees. I really like the mobile version of this with the centered text. I think a different typeface with either a drop shadow or some subtle transparent box behind it would make it more legible. </div>
