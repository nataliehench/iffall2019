	<h2> Natalie Hench Wireframe Feedback</h2>
	<div> Feedback from Cecilia:
	"Really like the colors  - very fitting of the theme type faces are appropriate maybe add more pix? I'm not sure but its great either way, number the steps for the directions? Condiser adding some visual divisions between the fonts
	**cookâ€™s notes - dont forget the apostrophe!"</div>

	<div> I'm going to try to add some more images, maybe using them as a way to separate the different sections. I'm also going to add numbers to the steps for the directions. I'm going to keep the overall look but I think some more clarity would help it be more successful.
